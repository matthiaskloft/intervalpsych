The **intervalpsych** package provides a toolbox for the analysis of interval responses in psychometrics and similar disciplines.
Interval responses can be used to represent uncertainty or variability in responses to survey items, for example. 
Besides transformation and plotting function, the package  also contains a wrapper to estimate the Interval Truth Model (ITM; [Kloft, Siepe & Heck, 2024](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/dzvw2)) in the probabilistic programming language [**Stan**](https://mc-stan.org/).
Results of the model can be visualized and summarized using the functions provided in the package.
